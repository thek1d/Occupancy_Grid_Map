# Occupancy_Grid_Map
Please rename the dataset from "Scan 1" to "Scan1" do this also for Scan2 and Scan3.
Do not include a Header into the dataset, just leave it as it is.

ToDo:
The plot function needs to be updated!
It generates for every Scan a own plot which need's to be closed for seeing the next plot.
No exception and error handling!
